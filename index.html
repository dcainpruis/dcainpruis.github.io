						Welcome to the website documentation for me, Dylan Cain-Pruis! 
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm a current student at Monash University in my fifth and final year.
						I graduate at the end of 2021 with a degree in Software Engineering (Hons) / Computer Science. 
						
					</p>
					<p>
						The projects displayed here are ones that I particularly enjoyed doing, found interesting, or have a user
						interface to show. During my time at university I've learnt a range of topics such as algorithms and datastructures, 
						software and cyber security, artifical intelligence, machine learning, and more. 
					</p>

					<p>
						For a functional programming unit at University, we had to program a version of the game
						Asteroids. In my version, a user has three lives and a life is lost everytime it collides
						with an asteroid. My favourite part of this project was implementing the collision algorithm. 
					</p>
					<p>
						First, the algorithm checks if the asteroid and user's ship are close by. Then it calculates vectors for
						each side of both polygons. Lastly, it checks for any intersections between the ship's vectors and
						the asteroid's vectors. This allowed more precise collision than a square hit box since the objects
						are rotating in space. Other notable features of the game are:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Destroying a large (red) asteroid splits it into two smaller (orange) asteroids.</li>
						<li>Asteroids destroyed add to the user score, which increase the level. A higher level increases asteroid density.</li>
						<li>The user has 3 lives only before game over. Colliding with an asteroid causes the asteroid to explode and a life to be lost.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>I'm not very good at the game as seen in the video below! </p>

						A desktop application was developed over the course of an entire unit that allowed a 
						health practitioner to sign in with an id and view a list of their patients that can be monitored. 
						The following are a list of features that were implemented:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Patients and information regarding their blood pressure and cholesterol are retrieved from a FHIR server.</li>
						<li>Data from the FHIR is updated on a frequency that is inputted by the user</li>
						<li>Patients from a list can be selected to monitor their blood pressure, cholesterol, or both in detail.</li>
						<li>Any patients that have a diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, or cholesterol above a certain user set threshold are highlighted.</li>
						<li>Line charts can be displayed to show change in readings over time for multiple patients.</li>
					</ul>
	
					<p>
						A large part of the software and assignments was to create software using design principles and patterns
						such that we could later extend the software. The software made use of observers, abstract
						factories, iterators, and more. 
					</p>
					<p>
						In the later assignment, extending the initial software was easy
						and required only a few refactors due to how it was initially designed.
					</p>
					<p>
						Below is an image of the patient monitor with a few patients displayed. Note all the data shown
						is fake data that was given to us by the university for completing the assignments.

						Goodreads provides a platform for reviewing, rating, and searching for books. When
						working on this project there was no feature to filter/sort a shelf for a specific
						genre. This project aims to create a solution to this, which consists of two 
						components:
					</p>	
				
					<div class="note">
						<ol>
							<li>A web scraper written in python</li>
							<li>A web application using django to display the scraped data and sort/filter it	</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
		
					<h2 class="content-subtitle">Web Scraper</h2>
						<p> 
							Currently, only books from the fantasy shelf, 
							https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/fantasy, are being scraped as that's the
							main genre of books that I read. Before book information can be retrieved, a 
							request must be made to login to gain access to more than the first page of
							the shelf. By analysing the HTML form the required key-value pairs required
							in the payload can be found and used for logging in. 
							<br><br>
							After logging in, the scraper retrieves the name of each book, the author, the average rating, 
							the number of ratings, the year published, and a thumbnail of the book cover.
							This information is saved for the application to use and does require updating
							occasionally as the values do change. Updating the information is as simple as
							starting the web application and going to the /scraper/ endpoint.
						</p>
					<h2 class="content-subtitle">Web application</h2>
						<p> 
							A simple web application is used to display the data retrieved from the scraper.
							The web application makes use of Django's templates to generate the HTML page
							dynamically using the data in the SQLite database. Javascript functionality
							implemented allows:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Exclusion of certain book names/series (i.e. can remove book series I've read)</li>
							<li>Selection within a range for rating, number of ratings, and year.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							 
							 The result is as seen in the image below. The UI is simplistic, but it provides
							 the functionality to help me search for books easier and it's found me multiple new
							 books to read.
							 <br><br>
							 Future work on the project includes creating a profile remember books that I've
							 read before so they are removed from the list and to also expanding the number of books in the database (currently 
							 1250).

							<li>An iOS application that is a work in progress</li>
							<li>Extends Goodreads+ and adds more features</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p>
						This is currently being developed as part of an iOS development unit. The aim of the app is
						the same as Goodreads+, but includes additional features for a user on top of the search functionality 
						and is for iOS instead of a website. The additional features of this application are:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Every user can add/remove books to default lists - what they have read or want to read</li>
						<li>Following the future work of Goodreads+, lists can be used to further filter lists by removing all books present in a selected list</li>
						<li>Users can rate, and review books or even recommend another book</li>
						<li>Users can create custom lists, which can be later shared and rated by other users</li>
						<li>Books will show ratings from outside sources (i.e. Goodreads or Google books) to get as much input from other people as possible</li>
						<li>The database of books will be initially populated with a selection of books retrieved using the web scraper from the Goodreads+ project</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						This section will be further updated with screenshots once the application is developed!

						My final year honours project involves building an application, with a team of 5, that will look
						for specific security vulnerabilities that are being exploited in some common file
						types and remove them. Users would be able to upload a document to the website and
						then download the resulting 'cleansed' file. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The project is currently in its initial phases and will span the entire year. This section
						will be updated when the project is completed.
