			<h2>University Projects</h2>
				<p class="endSection">
					The projects displayed here are ones that I particularly enjoyed doing and found interesting. I
					have completed many other projects at university in different areas such as cybersecurity, algorithms
					and data structures, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and web applications. A lot of these
					are either web APIs, console, or command line applications so aren't very interesting to show. 
				</p>
				<h3>Asteroids</h3>
					<p>
						A simple game of asteroids was created in typescript using functional programming 
						practices. The following are some features of the game: 
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Observables control the main game loop and manage the user input</li>
						<li>Asteroids destroyed add to the user score, which increase the level. A higher level increases asteroid density.</li>
						<li>The user has 3 lives only before game over. Colliding with an asteroid causes the asteroid to explode and a life to be lost.</li>
						<li>Collisions were implemented by using linear algebra and checking for intersection points 
							between the ship and the asteroids. This provides precise collision checking between rotating objects.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p> Note that I'm not very good at the game as seen in the video below! </p>

				<h3>Patient Monitor</h3>
					<p>
						A JavaFX desktop application was developed over the course of an entire unit that allowed a 
						health practitioner to sign in with an id and view a list of their patients that can be monitored. 
						The following are a list of features that were implemented:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Patients and information regarding their blood pressure and cholesterol are retrieved from a FHIR server.</li>
						<li>Data from the FHIR is updated on a frequency that is inputted by the user</li>
						<li>Patients from a list can be selected to monitor their blood pressure, cholesterol, or both in detail.</li>
						<li>Any patients that have a diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, or cholesterol above a certain user set threshold are highlighted.</li>
						<li>Line charts can be displayed to show change in readings over time for multiple patients.</li>
					</ul>
	
					<p>
						A large part of the software and assignments was to create software using design principles and patterns
						such that we could later extend the software. The software made use of observers, abstract
						factories, iterators, and more. In the later assignment when extending the initial software was easy
						and required only a few refactors due to how it was innitially designed.
						<br>
						Below is an image of the patient monitor with a few patients displayed. Note all the data shown
						is fake data that was given to us by the university for completing the assignments.

			<h2>Other Projects</h2>
				<h3>Goodreads advanced search</h3>
					<p> 
						Goodreads provides a platform for reviewing, rating, and searching for books. When
						working on this project there was no feature to filter/sort a shelf for a specific
						genre. This project aims to create a solution to this, which consists of two 
						components:
					</p>	
				
					<ol>
						<li>A web scraper written in python</li>
						<li>A web application using django to display the scraped data and sort/filter it	</li>
					</ol>

					<h4>Web Scraper</h4>
						<p> 
							Currently, only books from the fantasy shelf, 
							https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/fantasy, are being scraped as that's the
							main genre of books that I read. Before book information can be retrieved, a 
							request must be made to login to gain access to more than the first page of
							the shelf. By analysing the HTML form the required key-value pairs required
							in the payload can be found and used for logging in. 
							<br><br>
							After logging in, the scraper retrieves the name of each book, the author, the average rating, 
							the number of ratings, the year published, and a thumbnail of the book cover.
							This information is saved for the application to use and does require updating
							occasionally as the values do change. Updating the information is as simple as
							starting the web application and going to the /scraper/ endpoint.
						</p>
					<h4>Web application</h4>
						<p> 
							A simple web application is used to display the data retrieved from the scraper.
							The web application makes use of Django's templates to generate the HTML page
							dynamically using the data in the SQLite database. Javascript functionality
							implemented allows:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Exclusion of certain book names/series (i.e. can remove book series I've read)</li>
							<li>Selection within a range for rating, number of ratings, and year.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							 
							 The result is as seen in the image below. The UI is simplistic, but it provides
							 the functionality to help me search for books easier and it's found me multiple new
							 books to read.
							 <br><br>
							 Future work on the project includes creating a profile remember books that I've
							 read before so they are removed from the list and to also expanding the number of books in the database (currently 
							 1250).
